                Occasionally, substitutions may be necessary to create your
                bouquet due to the availability of certain flowers in various
                parts of the country. Care is taken to maintain the style, theme
                and color scheme of the arrangement, using flowers of equal
                value. Additionally, the substitution of certain keepsake items
                may be necessary due to increased demand, especially during
                major holidays. In single-flower arrangements, such as an all
                rose bouquet, or orchids, we will make every attempt to match
                the flower type, but may substitute with another color.

                    intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they
                    even are aware of them. We currently do not take action in
                    response to these signals.
